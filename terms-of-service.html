        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>Important Distinction:</strong> Coaching is not therapy, counseling, or medical treatment. Coaches do not diagnose, treat, or provide advice for mental health conditions.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Our coaching services are designed to help you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gain clarity on your goals, values, and purpose</li>

            <li>Build accountability and momentum toward your desired outcomes</li>
        </ul>

        <p>As coaches, we ask powerful questions, provide frameworks for reflection, and support you in discovering your own insights and next steps. <strong>We do not provide advice, diagnoses, or treatment.</strong> You are responsible for your own choices, actions, and results.</p>

        <p>If you are experiencing mental health challenges, we encourage you to seek support from a licensed therapist or counselor in addition to (or instead of) coaching services.</p>

        <h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>You must be at least <strong>18 years of age</strong> to use our services. By engaging our services, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years old and have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms.</p>

        <h2>4. Scheduling & Appointments</h2>

            <li>Having a quiet, private space for virtual coaching sessions</li>

            <li>Completing any agreed-upon actions between sessions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Cancellation & Rescheduling Policy</h2>

        <div class="important-box">

        <h2>6. Refund Policy</h2>

        <h3>Coaching Services</h3>
        <p>Due to the personalized nature of coaching and the time committed to each client relationship, <strong>coaching fees are generally non-refundable</strong> once services have begun.</p>

            <li><strong>Before first session:</strong> If you cancel before your first coaching session takes place, you may receive a full refund minus any administrative fees</li>

        <p>Retreat refunds follow the cancellation schedule outlined in Section 5 above.</p>

        <h3>Results Disclaimer</h3>
        <p>Results from coaching depend on many factors, including your active participation, openness to reflection, commitment to taking action, and individual circumstances. <strong>We do not guarantee specific outcomes or results.</strong> The non-refundable nature of our services reflects the commitment required from both coach and client for transformation to occur.</p>
